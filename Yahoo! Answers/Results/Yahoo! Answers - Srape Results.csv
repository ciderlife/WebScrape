https://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20110521190937AAE9pFP,Should i leave my gambling addcited husband?,0," I have discovered that my husband has had a gambling addiction the entire time i have known him.  I was a single mother of a two year old and had been in a relationship with a person who suffered narsasistic personality disorder.. i suffered physical and mental abuse in that relationship for three years.  I met my husband when my mum was passing away of cancer and he was the loving, caring, smart, handsome man i had never thought i would meet.   After a little lying and cheating early on, that he explained was hesitation in getting together with a single mother, we got serious in our relationship.  We moved in together and after six years we married.  Through this time there were some small lies, lies over trivial things.  When we married i made it clear to him i could not take any lies in the marriage.  While we were engaged we were renting, he lost his second job over lying about money and started up his own business and said it would take time to make a goos living so we moved in with my dad to save money for a house.   
For the following years he never seemed to make enough money.  He is in the medical profession and has the potential to earn good money but we always seemed to struggle with the simplest of things and if i didnt work we never would have made it. 
When we married money went missing from our wishing well and he had me convinced someone must have stolen from it.  He would borrow money out of my account to buy things for his business, but as he always put it back i never really took much notice. 
When i was told i had cancer i really started to wake up and smell the roses.  I worried about what would happen if i had to stop work, we payed no rent but i knew we would struggle.   
Lucky for me i had good news with the cancer, we were all relieved that i had a rare type of tumor that had low malignancy potential, so as long as i stay stress free threre is no reason it should progress to being aggressive as there is very low risk.  We were all relieved... however something was still nagging at me.  I started looking more closely at my husband.. he was looking unhealthy, he was always stressed out, skin problems, couldnt keep weight on, lack of motivation with work and general tardiness.  i kept thinking about how he never seemed to have money, how he had lied to me about things over time.  I spoke to my sisiter and she said the words ""i think he has a gambling problem"".   I honestly didnt want to believe it but i thought she was right. 
I demanded the codes to his bank accounts and relaised there were loans and credit cards and large ammounts of money being withdrawn from his account on certain days.  After being confronted he admitted to having a really bad money problem.  He said he was hopeless at controlling money and would spend money on stupid things, like nights out with the boys and the like.  Something wasnt sitting well with me and i told him we can work through this if confesses everything to me.  I told him due to my health i couldnt take another revelation and he swore black and blue there was nothing else.  He acted so relieved in telling me, started putting on weight and looking less stressed. 
Then he rang me one day with this story of how he went to a farewell for someone at the hospital and put $6 in a pokie machine and one a massive tv. 
I knew something wasnt right.  I sat him down and demanded he told me if he had a gambling problem and he finally admitted he did.  I was floored.  He started off making nothing of it and then admitted it is a massive problem.  Started as not much of a problem and now he sometimes goes from pokie venue to pokie venue wuthdrawing the maximum amount of money you can. 
I have researched this addiction, and i understand it is not about the 'win' it is about chasing the feeling they get from playing.  Seeing how long they can keep that feeling.  He is a complete closet gambler and noone knew, not even his best friends.  He would go alone.   
he is getting professional help, but i had to ask him to leave.  He is such a beautiful person, it breaks my heart he has this problem, but now everything is making sense. 
I just dont know if i can be in a marriage with someone with a problem due to my previuos relationship and worries about my health.  I feel i am being selfish if i dont let him try and get better and give him another chance, but i just dont think i have it in me to be seconf guessing everthing for the rest of my life.  Whay should i do?"

https://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20110514200040AA4mgaO,"Should I tell my husband I was molested as a child, or stick to my plan of pretending it never happened?",0," Hello, my name is Mitchel. 

This has been troubling me throughout my 16 year relationship with my husband ((We're 28, been together since 12)) 

There aren't words in any human language that can describe how much I love him. He's the air I breathe and he's the most beautiful human being I could ever hope to wake up next to every morning. 
Now we were both virgins before we got together, and remained that way until we lost it to each other at age 26. ((Yes we took it slow, we have our own personal reasons to do so and it had nothing to do with lack of love or attraction)) 

I've told him EVERYTHING about my life aside from one thing. When I was 6 I was sexually molested by my abusive father ((It was weird because he wasn't gay, he was just so angry at me, he thought it'd teach me a lesson to scar me.))  
The only people who know are myself, my father and my younger brother who accidentally witnessed the action. Not even my mother, who has taken care of my perfectly all my life knows. 

After it happened, I remember promising myself it never happened, and I carried on like it never happened. But now I'm wondering if I should tell him, or stick to my plan and treat it like it never happened.  

I still have nightmares about it at least 2-3 times a week, but I blame it on the fact that I am a child therapist and I hear some traumatizing stories.

https://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=20110216131436AAoO5q8,"Should I move to Atlanta to start a new life, how's life there?",5," I am looking for a city similar to NYC but I dont wanna move to Miami or LA 

Atlanta is the only other major one that crosses my mind but I have only been there once. My cousin lives there, I think he lives in buck head or bank head, not sure. His apartment complex is the most luxurious gated complex I have ever seen. It looked like it was built for royalty, you actually have to dial at the gate for him to open it. And the call goes straight to his cell and he can open it from there. We dont have stuff like that in NY. He only pays $900 for a 2 bedroom, thats great. I am tired of suffering in NY paying $1500 for a small sh*t hole, I need to move to the south! NYC is too overrated  

I am a Trinidadian so I wanna go to place with lots of immigrants (whether it be Russians, Indian, Jamaicans, Africans...etc), lots of restaurants (such as Spanish and Caribbean restaurant), public transport so I wont have to rely on my car, lots of jobs, night life...etc 

Is Atlanta the place for me? 

From what I heard Atlanta is on the rise ad will be the next big thing 

When I was younger no one cared about Atlanta and it was just known for hair and pimpin, but now Atlanta seems like heaven. Everyone is moving from the North to the South because they realized the North is expensive and its a sh*t hole. Everyone is come to TN, GA and TX 

Whats your take on it, and should I move here? 

I have like 5k saved up so that should get me into an apartment with a down payment. The same week I move there I will take my security Guard course (which is like 1 hr) and get the certificate, I will then apply for my Georgia guard card and work as a security guard until I settle down and find a better job. They are always on need of security guards and it looks better of you have your guard card so I think thats agood plan to keep me afloat while getting situated. APD is also hiring and I am going to go to their job fair this Saturday to put in an application there as well 

I plan on making the final move in MAY after I finish up this semester in NY, I am not sure which college I wanna transfer too but I will put college on hold until I get a steady job that can pay the rent 

What do you think about my plan? I wanna enjoy life and not have to struggle, anyone who lived in NY knows its a struggle"

https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20071022064149AAtcfjc,Should we remove baseboards before painting walls?,1," My husband has this idea in his head that it makes sense to remove all of the baseboards in our house in order to paint the walls.  It’s not that he wants to replace them; he wants to pry all of the baseboards to paint them & the walls and then put the old repainted baseboards back up.  This sounds like an unnecessary step to me because we run the risk of breaking them, or forgetting where each piece goes, and we’ll still have to fill the nail holes and paint over those once we reinstall the boards.    

After running through a list of people I know who have painted their homes in recent memory and finding no one who has engaged in this practice, I asked, “Who do you know that has actually done this?”  His response: “Lots of people.”  (In his language, this translates to “No one I know has actually done this, but I refuse to admit that.)  

Does anyone with half a brain actually do this?   We have so many projects on our plate, that I would love to get this on off the list."

I can sing it and feel lots of sensations in my throat, or more specifically, I get a lot of buzzing at my vocal cords and actually feel them moving. The other way is I don't feel the sensations in my throat/vocal cords much. Rather, it feels like my throat/vocal cords aren't buzzing and the sound feels away from me, out of my body, aimed towards my teeth . 

I breath with my diaphragm (my stomach is expanded until I'm done singing the phrase) . My question is what are the right sensations to feel when singing correctly? What should you be feeling and where should you be feeling these sensations? Buzzing, movement, sensations of the vocal cords or not much at all?"

https://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=20090309111853AA3nN7m,Should the man pay for EVERYTHING in a relationship?,3," My last girlfriend was a nice person but she had this view that I was supposed to pay for EVERYTHING in the entire relationship. Whenever we went for vacation, she wanted me to buy EVERYTHING when we did things together the whole time, she wanted me to pay for plane tickets for her and me, everything. Drinks I had to pay for. Back then we both made the same amount of money and have the same amount of money, but her thinking was that I was the guy, and only because I was a guy, I was supposed to pay.  

I used to say that ""In the 1950's, women didn't go to college much and have jobs and the gender roles were different, but now women have more opportunities and even go to college more than men"" and I said ""women are just as smart as men are, and can earn and pay for their own things, even though I don't mind spoiling you once in a while here and there"".  

Is this view of her's correct, do you agree with it? All she said was ""I'm a guy"", the ""guy is supposed to pay"", ""you should show your love for me by paying"", etc. Meanwhile, all the money she had she enjoyed for herself."

https://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20101006064313AAh0K9P,Should you buy friends birthday presents if they won't return the favour?,1," I am getting really angry at the moment because I'm spending copious amounts of money on my friends presents and then not being given a gift back. 

Please know, that I don't just buy them gift's so they will buy me one in return, I buy them gifts because it's the way I have been raised and I consider it to be a factor of general polietness. 

This has happend five times in the last 3 months.  

I went to my friends 18th birthdy party and spent 30.00 dollars and got her jewelerey. She said she loves it etc. She then said 'Oh you will love the present I'm going to get you'.  

When it came to my birthday dinner, she didn't even buy me a card, she just said, 'oh I found the perfect present and will give it to you soon! I'm sorry I don't have it now, I've just been caught up on what to buy you'. It's not the fact she didn't buy me anything, it's the fact she didn't even get a little card saying happy birthday. I'm also angry because she lied, she hasn't gotten me anything. 

The second time was when it was my friends 17th Winter Wonderland picnic and as her birthday gift was being posted from Ebay I got her a 'pre present' to show my apologies. I got her a lovely framed photo of us both. And a really nice card telling her the rest of her present was coming.  

When I saw her next I gave her the rest of her present and she was so happy.  

When it was my birthday dinner she got me a card saying she's sorry for not buying me anything but she's broke and the present is on the way. Fair enough, a card will suffice fine and I was quite happy because its the thought that counts. But she like my other friend, LIED and didn't get me anything. 

Now I don't care that they didn't get me anything, but I'm getting really annoyed at the friends of mine who have to lie and say they will get me something and never do. I just think it's extremely rude.  

One of my really close friends didn't even get me a card when I spent 120.00 dollars on her present and posted it to her.  

One of my closest friends didn't get me anything because she had no money, not even a card.I'm annoyed because she previously bitched about one of her friends not even getting her a card, yet she did the same thing to me. It also pissed me off because she is quite wealthy and could of borrowed money for a freaking card, considering I spent alot of money on her.  

I'm also extremely angry because I'm spending over $400.00 on a weekend getaway with two of them and they couldn't be bothered to get me a little card.  

I'm not rich and my family hardly has any money, so alot of saving went into that weekend getaway.  

I know I must sound like an idiot who has too much time on her hands, and I know I'm venting alot, but It's just really annoying me and making me feel quite angry that I go to all this trouble and don't even get a card in return.  

I'm also wasting alot of money on them when I could be saving for a car.

Or should I unblock her so when she curiously visits my page she'll realize what she's missing. I'm posting pictures of me with a bunch of girls and show that I'm happily moving on. I don't want her to think that's my intention though. 

Now if I keep her blocked and she gets so curious that she makes a new Facebook page just to see what I'm up to, the impact would be that much greater, right? She'd climb the invisible wall (bypassing my blocking her) to fall into the snake pit (discovering the reality of how happy I am without her). However, she may not be that curious.

https://ph.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100331045728AAiDiRU,Should I Join Facebook? Why and Why not?,0," I have received quite a few emails from people I know requesting me to view their pictures or profile on FB.When I click on the link to try and view them I am taken to a FB page informing me that I must sign-up for a FB account to view the pictures or profile. I don’t care to become a FB member so I politely email the person back informing them that I can not view their page/pictures due to my reluctance to join FB. Why should I join FB? And more importantly, why does FB force people to sign up just to view a friends stuff? 

The fact that FB requires one to join to view a persons profile is really annoying to me. Especially, since you know that one day (if they haven’t already) they will boast about how many people have joined FB. This, to me is something a communist dictator would do. Force the people of their country to join their political party (or die) and then boast to the world about the numbers in their political party. Okay, bad comparison, but you get my point. Another issue I have with FB is the impression I get from these sites. They appear to me, to give off an adolescent vibe. How many of you have received one of those emails saying, “Juan Dela Cruz, (use any name) is requesting you to be their friend. Click here to visit their profile.” This might have been okay in elementary school but come on people, grow up! Be their friend?! I say, get a life! FB which instead requests you to ""be their fan"". In my opinion, conveys an adolescent vibe which I find hard to ignore. FB was started by a couple of young college grads to keep in touch. This explains the youthful vibe the site emits. 

I realize I am in the minority here. Most people are okay with FB. And some even think it’s okay to post mind numbing worthless information about themselves. Everywhere I look I see references to FB including on business advertisements. “Find us on Facebook” most say. So many people are on FB that corporations have determined that it’s worth spending money maintaining a FB page and other related advertisement. There seems to be an FB craze these days with no end in site. Perhaps some changes though are not so far away. Last year (July 2009), in Chicago, a woman has been sued due to the content of one of her Tweets (I assume people reading this know what a Tweet is. Sorry if you don’t). In her posting she complained about mold in the apartment she rented and made mention of the property management company. The lawsuit claims her Twitter posts ""maliciously and wrongfully"" slammed her apartment at 4242 N. Sheridan and the company managing it. Perhaps if she looses this case, the word will get out that you will be held liable for what you post online, so choose wisely about what you type. Will the quality of online content then improve? I'm certain any improvement will be negligible. 

I understand that for some people FB provide a way to make their foot-print on the world wide web. Not everyone is computer savvy enough to build their own website, willing to pay to have one created for them or has the time to do either. Most social networking sites are free to join and easy to set up. In a matter of minutes, one can join, set up a profile and send thousands of requests to everyone they know to view their page. In my opinion nothing is wrong with that; just don’t assume everyone will view your page. Not everyone will join FB when invited and not everyone lives their lives through FB. If you have something you really want to share with someone, send them an email. It's a little more personal in my opinion. 

I hope this FB fad fades soon, but I realize that's just wishful thinking. Instead, it’s likely to morph into a more mature format that more people will adopt. FB is still very young and will grow until it invades the space of a bigger fish. As soon as they pose a threat of capturing a large percentage of a market of mutual interest,the big fish will try and eat them. 

I have always been a black sheep and proud of it......Okay, Perhaps a tad anti-FB too ; )"

Lets be honest, humans arn't different to animals and to me the alpha male should always be the leader, it's fighting against nature for me if that's not that case. 

I've also noticed that women love a man who takes charge and especially when he stands up to her, advice for any guys reading this who are being treated bad, stand up to your woman and notice how much she'll like you for it. 

To me it's degrading seeing a woman tell a man what to do, people may think this is offensive, however it's just human nature as far as i'm concerned. 

I know some men (and women) can be abusive which is wrong obviously, I think man should treat his woman with respect, but I beleive it's important for the man to always be in charge if he wants to have any dignity and respect of other including his partner.

https://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=20090908220555AAdIOlC,How tight should the tank be attached to the toilet?,2," I recently replaced an old leaky toilet with an American Standard Champion 4 model.  I'm a pretty competent DIY'er but am a bit concerned about how tightly to run down the through bolts that attach the tank to the toilet bowl. 

The instructions say, and I quote:  ""With the tank parallel to wall, alternately tighten hex nuts until tank is snugged down evenly against bowl surface."" 

OK, here's my concern.  If it's overtightened you risk breaking a new $300 toilet.  But the rubber gasket is fairly tightly compressed and the tank is not yet touching the lands on the back of the toilet bowl.  It's tilted slightly forward (about 1/8"" inch space between the rear lands than the front one where the tank is touching the bowl) but does not wiggle with moderate pressure.  Everything works fine, no leaks, etc.  But it just looks like it's not tightened down enough. 

Do I risk breaking the new toilet by carefully running the nuts even tighter until the rear of the tank rests on the lands on the back of the bowl?  (A test fit without the gasket had the tank squarely on the toilet bowl.)  Or should I leave it as is since everything works properly even though the tank IS still tilted slightly forward? 

Any guidance from experienced plumbers is greatly appreciated."

I'm thinking about double majoring with one major being Theatre.  I'm not sure if I should concentrate in Acting or Musical Theatre. 

Here's the thing.....I have VERY little dance training and I can't dance very well.  I can do basic movement and those classic theatre steps, but I'm fair at best.  Dance theory is a whole other issue....I couldn't name a step if you asked me...(with the exception of like....pirouette[sp?], ball-change, etc.)  I'm totally willing to learn and give it my best try, but I'm not very confident in my ability to learn to dance.  I'm uncoordinated and klutzy.   

I'd really love to concentrate in Musical Theatre because its where my heart truly lies.  The school that is my number one choice at the moment is Temple University.  I'll be getting more info on how much dance knowledge is required to audition for their department, but in the mean time...I'd like your opinion.  Should I just forget Musical Theatre?"

Does honouring that trust require the whole truth?  Perhaps all relationships rely on little white lies, to a degree – like pretending not to notice an attractive neighbour, or claiming that your spouse is every bit as attractive as you thought 25 years ago.  But what about deeper secrets?  Some people would feel that certain painful truths might be better hidden from their partners because the facts could only be hurtful, or consider some secrets to be nobody else's business so long as no harm is done.  Others would say that anything important needs to be fully out in the open between lovers and that real love and intimacy can't thrive on anything else.  Where do you stand?

My mother set me up on a date with someone she know who is 22. She always does this to get be to become more social. I started texting this guy and it turned out we had a lot in common. When we went on a date together, he was such a gentlemen. He paid for everything and dealt with my awkwardness which I have a feeling he thinks is cute. By the end of the night he figured out I was a virgin by my reactions to some funny sexual jokes. I wasn't put off by them because my friends and I joke too but I still blushed. He was fine with me being inexperienced. We text constantly and they are usually flirty and get naughty. I play along with them because it's fun but I feel like the next time I see him, which is this weekend, he might want to seriously do sexual things with me. Again, me being inexperienced and awkward, I'm a little scared. It's not that I think my virginity is something special, I just don't feel comfortable about myself. I am always told I have a nice body and I love it. It's just that I'm going to be exposed to someone else who I have only known for a month. I'm not even sure if we are in a relationship or just dating. I do believe that I can do some things and if it goes too far I'll tell him to slack off but is it too soon to be doing any of this with him? 

Truth be told this guy is on my mind almost all the time. My friends noticed a change in me saying I'm more lively and talkative. I never get noticed by guys but this one seems genuinely interested in me and I really like him. I'm just afraid that I'm letting things move too fast.

I was just wondering how often I should change the dry food and water? Normally when the amount in the dry food bowl gets low I add more food. as for the water, my grandma advised me to change it every 12 hours, but I have a small water bowl. Does it make a difference? Normally I'll change the water just whenever and when there's no more water (by whenever I mean sometimes 3 days, sometimes 24 hours, never over a week) 
I already tried looking it up on the internet and got nowhere. Am I doing OK? I'm asking more for the water then the dry food, but you know, just in case I should add more on a schedule instead of when it gets low. Thanks!"

https://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20130508114604AAmbqWI,Why should women have equal rights?,0," Since Women began to vote and gain equality, the world has rapidly began changing its views on certain things. 

Men just about have their nuts tied up, cant look at a women's assets (even if she's showing them off tremendously), Cant wolf whistle without being publicly scorched by the ladies wrath...not to mention the lawsuit on sexual harassment that follows.  

Men are literally jumping through hoops to get laid, and as a result of the tightened vaginal sanctioning men have become more aggressive towards one another, constantly trying to out do each other and compare...as well as the poor one percenters of women who are continuously picking up the slack for the lack of vaginal rehabilitation men have on offer....we call these women ''wh*res''. 

don't worry, There's plenty of problems with the male variety of the human species, but for now lets focus on the effects women's rights have had on society.  

''Change'' Is something most people are NOT keen on....but rather too lazy to protest, While on the other hand, women are advocating minority views based on social influences such as 

- news 
- magazines 
- social media 
- Hollywood 
- old fashioned gossip 

do we honestly believe Obama is the right president? or did he win majority votes from women (and 92% of black people) based on his ethnicity? or the fact he is quite good at giving presidential speeches? 

does everyone really want marriage to be diluted by including gays? they already had civil unions which gave them the same benefits...seems like they are very in-your-face-with-my-rights about something not everyone is comfortable with.  

DO WOMEN deserve equal rights?  

How many centuries have men been drafted into the army....sent off to a foreign country only to die cold and alone in a ditch? while women are merely put to work making bandages and other stuff? 
the next time there's a world war...should women be lining up in the trenches too? 

How about all those tough jobs women can't do? like being deep underground in tight and unstable dangerous mines? or under heavy trucks all day or sweating it out under the hot sun labouring? 

WHY CANT WE JUST TREAT WOMEN LIKE WOMEN and MEN LIKE MEN? 

does the modern family suffer from lack of gender obligations? have we lost morality because of this movement?

I love helping people who are in a weak and vulnerable state. I helped care for my grandma everyday when she was dying ( basically doing the duties of a cna).

I think it would be the best thing in the world to save someone's life. I am concerned about trying to become a doctor because of how difficult it is to get into med school and also the difficulty of med school itself. That's why I was considering physician assistant; and also because I heard they do less paper work and don't have to deal with lawsuits. I am considering physical therapist because quite a few people have told me I should become a physical therapist ( including a physical therapist) and because they spend so much time with patients and I would be able to express my compassion.

I didn't have a problem paying cuz it sort of made me feel good and never really thought twice about it.  However, when things started to get serious she brought up the topic of ""money"".  She believes that the man should pay all the time.  Infact, she EXPECTS it.  Here's the funny thing.  We both make the same amount of money.  We both have the same amount of debt to pay off (which is hardly any).   Her explanation was that she likes to feel taken care of.  I know this is a very ""old fashioned"" way of thinking and I'm actually very much for it, however this rule only applies to women who don't have jobs and choose to stay home in order to cook, clean, and take care of the family. This girl does not know how to do any of these things.  Why is it that most women who demand independence don't really know the true meaning of it?  If you want the man to pay for everything, then shouldn't the woman put into the relationship (like cook, clean, drive, other house duties, etc)?  No. Sex is not payment.  That's equivalent to being a prostitute.  You're thoughts on this subject?"

Sure, they've give me notes maybe once for our project so I can start on the up for them, but their information sort of suck and they very rarely give input into our assignment. They also fail to reference materials which we're supposed to list. One guy talks to the girl he likes all class and maybe types up three sentences the entire class of information I already have and emails it to me, another one has no idea what is going on, two others rarely contribute except for a couple pages of useless notes and another one claims she's assisting me with the write up, but she hasn't really done much except distract me. 

I'm not a mean person, and I don't have the heart to tell them they aren't really contributing to our assignment, and I'm scared if I do tell them, they'll all get mad at me and start rumours. I also don't want to come across as arrogant. I'm a bit of a perfectionist and cannot work with lazy people, so I'm getting peeved. I want to tell my teacher in private before class starts one day and explain the situation, but I think that won't resolve anything as it's partially my fault for letting them be lazy and get away with doing next to nothing.

With 10percent deflation, after one year you should be able to sell the building for...? and more?",0," 1)You are running a business and you need some extra space for 1 year. Your bank offers you a loan of 200,000 at zero percent interest. You consider borrowing this amount, buying the building, using it for one year, and then selling the building to pay back the loan.  

Unfortunately, the economy in which you are operating is experiencing deflation at the rate of 10 percent per year. 

After one year, you should be able to sell the building for 
a)220,000 
b)200,000 
c)180,000 

2)Suppose that owning the building for a year would earn you 12,000. What should you do? 

a)You should not buy the building because in one year it will cost you 200,000, because when the nominal interest rate is zero, the cost of a building is its full purchase price 

b)You should definitely buy the building because you can borrow 200,000 at zero interest while the building will generate 12,000 in extra income. Then when you sell it, you will be 12,000 richer. This is because when the nominal interest rate is zero, you do not incur any cost when you take out a loan. 

b)You should not borrow it because if you sell the building in a year, you will have to come up with more money to pay off the loan than you will make in extra income. This is because the extra income you will earn will be less than the cost of owning the building for the year.

(+ more questions)?,0," I have this old guitar at home and I took a few lessons when i was in grade six (6 years ago), then I stopped taking lessons and I abandoned it. I didn't learn so much and I forgot most of what I learned. I gave up at the time because I found that I lacked the motivation for it, my fingers hurt and I felt Insecure. 

However, I want to learn to play the guitar now or, atleast the ukulele, which is why I regret dropping those lessons. :P I'm quite motivated to expand my skills and learn to play the ukulele or guitar. 
Is the ukulele easier to learn? Should I learn in first before I learn the guitar?  

Or, should I start with the piano, since I have a keyboard at home and I already know a couple of songs? 

Also, is it possible to be self-taught or to learn from youtube videos and books, or is it better to pay for lessons? Which is the faster or most efficient way to learn?"

also i am in highschool so i have 10 different teachers who are all probably going to ask me about it and i will have to face the awkwardness when they ask me in the middle of class in front of everyone

What triggered this question to me, is the thought of someone who would purposely starve themselves to death. I know for a fact that starvation is one of the most painful deaths possible, and someone who is purposely putting themselves through that physical pain in order to die, must be experiencing even worse mental pain.

She's going to be a senior this year in high school.  We gave her a car when she turned 17 and put her on our insurance policy.  Her insurance runs us $80/month.  We have been paying this for almost a year now.  I feel that since she has a job, and has no other financial responsibilities (besides her cell phone), she should be paying this insurance.  She is very irresponsible with money, and spends money on a lot of frivolous things.  I think having her pay her own insurance each month would help teach her fiscal responsibility.

https://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20120730192206AAubxpV,Should I be worried that my boyfriend watches porn?,0," Me and my boyfriend are 21, we have been together for 8 months. We lost our virginity to each other, and we have sex almost everyday, or 4-5 times a week minimum. We both enjoy making love, and satisfy each other. I am stating this because I could understand why a man would resort to porn if his partner did not please him. 

My boyfriend thinks I'm attractive, and I feel I am, I get asked out a lot by men. I'm blonde, I'm petite but I have e-cup breasts and a big butt. That sounds egotistical I know but I'm just trying to emphasize my feelings of confusion as to why he watches porn when he has the goods at home? 

I found out because it was on his phone, I kept it inside and tried not to let it bother me, but it was sort of making me feel inadequate and I started to question whether I was attractive. I finally got the courage to ask why he does? He was defensive but he said he doesn't know why but that it's a 'habit' because he was a virgin for so long. He has said he wouldn't want 'a pornstar' and agrees they're gross, but then I don't get why he enjoys watching them? He says I'm a lovely girl who his parents love and thats what he wants.  

So if you love me and I'm all you want? Why watch porn? I feel like it's not right, I would be worried if I was fantasizing about another man, and that's what I feel he is doing. I'm not a controlling girlfriend, I don't want to ask him to change and I know if I told him to stop he would only hide it better, haha. But are there any guys (or girls!) out there who can help me understand this porn thing? Coz, at the moment it's eating into my confidence and my certainty in his attraction to me. To put it simply, it's making me rather sad. Is this a problem? Do ALL guys really do this? And... how can I accept this?"

I have studied for several years to get into this field, and my foot is finally in the door. But, since I do most of my work at home, I have only been in the office for 1-2 days a week, and only for a few hours at a time. So I don't know my colleagues that well. Also, I am about half the age of most of my colleagues and, hence, feel somewhat awkward around them. There are only a couple of people who I feel really comfortable with (the people who I work with directly). I will just add that everyone in my department seems to have been working there forever, so they are all really close. 

I am not guaranteed a job next year, as I am on a sort of trial run. But I have been invited to the Christmas party. 

Now, it is not that I cannot socialise, as I am great in one-on-one situations. I feel comfortable, and I can talk openly and even be funny. But I feel awkward in a group situation when I am around people that I don't know well. Awkward to the extent that my hands start to shake and I cannot speak at all. My greatest fear at a party is that everyone will kind of form their own groups of 2-3 and I will be left standing on my own with no one to talk to. This tends to happen to me a lot, and I never have any idea what to do. 

So should I attend the Christmas party? I feel as though not going would be a really bad decision.

i have a few things to say: 

- if people smoked marijuana on the scale that people smoke cigarettes or get on the drink (which would probably happen if it was legalized), then there would be a similar amount of deaths. 

- ok, nobody has died as a direct result of smoking marijuana, but i suppose nobody has died as a direct result of smoking cigarettes. im sure people die from long term lung problems of smoking marijuana. turns out most people who do weed also smoke cigs, so i guess you can just all blame that. consider this, it would be like having a ton more alcoholics running around. 

- if alcohol was made illegal, i am almost certain it would be classified a soft drug, because way less people would do it, and therefore less deaths. this is much similar to marijuana. if marijuana were legal, more people would die from it and it would be classified as a hard drug. 

im not saying dont smoke weed, im saying to the people who think it should be legalized, to screw your heads on properly, and recognise it will never be legalized. 

although i wish it was legal without these problems and other social problems, it is best it remain illegal."

https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20130312114142AAHOXPw,I am a gay Muslim. I feel sick!! What should I do?,1," I am an 18 years old guy. When I was younger I had always thought that I was weird somehow. I’m Muslim, and I come from a really strict family. My country doesn’t speak about homosexuality at all. Actually, if you are caught in action with another man, you’re going to be put to death. I was born gay, and I have never had deep nor sexual feelings for a female. That is why I get really mad when people say communicate with God and he will heal you and make you straight. Well, he didn’t. I respect all religions, and I do believe in God. That’s why when I was younger I tried to pray and ask God to release me from this curse I’m in. Nobody knows that I am gay. It’s not an easy subject to discuss in my country because most of the people are extremists and strict Muslims. When I was living back home I had always thought that it’s a passing thing and I will be straight when I grow up and marry a woman and have kids. But, I moved to the United States for a couple of years to study. I actually just got to the United States. So, I will have 3 more years here.  Before I moved here I would consider myself religious and that’s why I couldn’t believe that God made me this way. But, when I moved here everything about me has changed, I literally started to see the World from a different angle. I started accepting myself, but I’m really devastated and depressed. Suicide is one of the biggest sins that you could ever commit as a person in Islam and actually that is the only reason that is keeping me going. I have always had suicidal thoughts but I never acted on them. Still, I am always depressed to the part where I stop eating for days, and it’s not because I’m trying to kill myself, but whenever I eat I throw up. Knowing for a fact that eventually I will not have someone to love or kids really devastates me. And this continuous fear that if someone figures out who I really am, I will be killed really terrifies me. Also, if I do tell my parents that I am gay there is a high chance that they would disown me. I got to this point where I don’t care about my life, I just need someone to love or talk to. It’s true what they say “Life is Mystery.” I have no idea where life is taking me. I am on a vacation now, and all I did was pretend that I am sick so I don’t go outside and see people because all I see are families with kids. And this makes me even sicker. The issue is that my scholarship pays my tuition, but I MUST work for them for five years (in my country). I think I need to either sacrifice my family to find someone who loves me and move away with him (this will also kill me because during this period in the US I get homesick sometimes). So, I can’t see myself ditching my family forever. Why is God torturing me? He made me gay and made me SO emotionally needy and then he says it’s forbidden to love someone from your same gender. I feel sick. Any suggestions what can I do with my life?"

https://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=20120220100055AAbhq4I,Should I buy a Roku instead of cable?,3," My family has a tv, but we only have the about $25 a month cable. We get 20 channels and half of them are in Spanish and most of the other ones are the same thing on 2 or 3 channels. The only channels we get are several news channels, pbs, and that's pretty much it. I want to buy a Roku or something like that. We have WiFi. I was thinking of buying a Roku, either Hulu Plus or Netflix, and then MLB.tv. In the end, would that be cheaper than what we're paying now or a little more a month but worth it because of the more channels?  

Roku: $49.99-$99.99, depending on the model 
Netflix: $7.99/month 
Hulu Plus: $7.99/month 
MLB.tv: $124.99/year, = about $15/month for the months we would have it, but we would have to pay the full amount up front, not monthly. 
I think the monthly subscription fees would equal out to about the same, would it be worth it? And then there's the harder question: Netflix or Hulu Plus? I've heard Netflix is better for watching movies and Hulu Plus is better for watching TV shows because there's more of a selection, but when I searched their selections, Netflix had more of the TV shows we would potentially be watching. If we get a Roku, I would do the free trial of each before deciding. What do you think I should do? Thanks!"

I agree with child-care, not a massive child-care system that every single mother goes too because people can't practice sexual restraint.

https://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20140117223921AAoQrvV,Should I follow my dreams of becoming an actress or face reality?,0," I've really been amazed by the showbiz world even since I was a toddler, especially actors and actresses and their amazing ability to look like someone completely different to the audience. Ever since then, I've really wanted to be into acting - When people usually watch a movie for their plot, I just use the movie as a place to learn facial expressions and techniques to make a scene look much more realistic. I really want to be an actor so bad, as in, I'm never gonna stop this passion for acting but my parents have just told me to face reality. 

I don't want to believe them, that, ""Learning engineering and becoming a teacher or a lawyer will earn you more money and is a much more secure and safer future."" However, in reality, it is probably very true. I've got nowhere to ""start"" my acting career because I still have school to attend, even though I heard that ""the earlier you begin to learn something, the farther it will get you"". I feel that I need to get my butt of my chair right now and do something that will help follow my dreams in the future, but every time I try, I always face the obstacles of ""having no time because of school"" and of course, ""facing reality"". 

I really wanna be optimistic and be an actress though, but I'm kinda stuck between 2 paths that I have no clue in which one to follow. I'm still young, in the very early teens (I actually don't know if that's considered young anymore) but I would really like some advice from someone who has experienced this before. I mean, if my mother, who has lived for a long time knows what she's talking about, then I'm not sure what I should do anymore haha. Especially since I don't want to live the rest of my life doing things that I do not enjoy. Thank you if you read it all, I know it's pretty long. :) Haha."

I've already got a rather large tattoo on my inner arm that boss HATES (she hates all tattoos) however because I had it before the new rules came in, I don't have to keep covered. I don't know if she can actually fire me for getting another visible tattoo, but she'll definitely punish me in whatever way she legally can. My thinking is, because this new one is so small, it'll be easily coverable by bracelets, a watch, etc and if I ask her and she says no flat out, then I've lost all plausible deniability if I get it done and try to hide it. I just don't know whether its worth the risk?

https://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=20100826024255AAH7Leh,Should women be allowed to go topless in public...or not?,3," Hi folks. 

When viewing an enlightening article on CNN this morning, I was moved to consider the question of whether women should or should not be allowed to be topless in public. 

After some thought on the subject, here is what I found to be the primary motivators on both sides of the issue, namely... 

THE ""PROS"": 

1. Freedom. 

There is much to be applauded about living in a free society without any question whatsoever...but how far should freedom be allowed to go without society being degraded? 

2. Equality. 

The women who insist that they should have the same rights as men are quite vehement about their cause, and from my viewpoint this is quite understandable...but are these women 100% certain of their real true motivations behind the claim of ""Equality"", or is it simply veiled jealousy of men's ability to be seen in a non-sexual light when their shirts are off, or if that is not exactly correct, at least far less sexually provocative as women are with their breasts fully exposed? 

And also, are these women who are firm supporters (no bra puns intended ladies) in actuality simply trying to gain even more attention than they already get for themselves everyday, while hiding under the auspices of ""Freedom"" and ""Equality""? 

There is another side to this issue, but I think it belongs in the following catagory. 

THE ""CONS"": 

1. The Morality Issue. 

With the knowledege that there are most certainly tribal societies that have existed for countless centuries that allow women to bare their breasts publicly, still, our modern ""Civilized"" society is factually not ready for such things, and perhaps there may be good reasons...but from my viewpoint not necessarily for the reasons forwarded by the followers of most established religions. 

In other words, what I mean is that factually speaking, modern heterosexual men are highly attracted to women's breasts to the point of intense feverishness, and women know this by the way - which shows a clear reason why many women might wish to have the attention poured upon them in such a way, but there are factually men who cannot control themselves when they are confronted by such an obvious and open display of female sexuality, from which breasts cannot easily or simply be removed...true or not true? 

For this reason, perhaps the laws are in place not to ""resrict"" women from their inherent freedoms, but rather to PROTECT THEM from men or persons that may simply not be able to control themselves, especially when drunk or on drugs, etc.. 

If this is the case, which I think it very likely is, then that would mean that by removing the laws, women in favor of this would then be literally removing a potentially vital layer of protection which keeps them safe to walk the streets at any time of the day or night. 

2. And lastly, there is the issue of common decency. 

Look, although we might be intelligent beings and have the sovereign right to all good freedoms in general, not all women happen to look like Claudia Schiffer, Gisele Bundchen or Naomi Cambell. 

In fact, let's face it...most women do not do not look like these incredible, super-bodied, gorgeous icon-like women, and they simply never will. 

(Sorry ladies, but this is a fact)! 

Therefore, is it not also the sovereign right of all those (the masses including small children) who would then become forced onlookers of the bare breasted women in question to have their rights upheld and not be forced to have to view legions of boob-airing women exercising their right to expose their not-necessarily-so-beautiful-looking mammaries in public? 

And what about the women themselves? 

Even if their breasts are possibly somehow even better looking than a supermodel's, what about their own sense of decency and the other issue of feeling good about being protected from those unwanted persons who would not be able to control their actions by seeing them in such a state of un-dress? 

The true end point of this seems to revolve more around the concept of the interaction between freedom of exposure versus freedom from being sexually provoked on the other side of the issue, and the potentially devastating consequences that could arise from this freedom being violated - such as rape and/or sexually aggravated assault or even worse. 

Women who wish to bare their breasts publicly should perhaps theoretically have the right to do so, but conversely, the innocent masses who wish to retain the freedom to be free of being forced to deal with viewing hordes of topless women parade around in public also have rights...yea, or nay?

I never knew of this other book by James Joyce or how long the senteces are in this last episode. Now Im going to read the book as well as write my paragraph on Dental Assisting!!!"

https://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=20060809115422AAdvEmO,Replacing Interior doors - What size should I order?,0," I'm worried about 2 bedroom doors that I've ordered.  The widths of my existing doors are 30 3/4 inches, and 30 1/2 inches. The guy at the hardware store suggested that I go with a 30 inch widths for the new doors, and now I'm having doubts.  

The space in between the frames (which I'm keeping) appears to be exactly 30 inches wide - is it necessary to have a little extra width on either side of the door, overlapping the frame?  Should I change the order to go up to the next size (32 inch width) and shave the new doors down to match the existing ones, or will I really be O.K. with the 30 inch width for the new ones?

https://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20091103124502AAemiMn,Should we allow asylum seekers into Australia (without locking them up)?,0," As far as I know, we currently break international law by either forcing them away from our shores or locking them in detention centres (basically prisons). There seemse to be widespread opposition over here to letting these people into our country, and I do not understand why. 

We claim to be a multicultural society, and one of the greatest nations in the world, but we completely screw these people over! Clearly, being asylum seekers, these people are fleeing something at least moderately horrible. The fact that even the government calls them by this term illustrates that yes, these people are fleeing persecution, and yes, their lives are probably already pretty s%^t. 

Why do we make their lives worse? How can we justify breaking international law? We have a relatively alright society, with plenty of wealth, so why don't we share? 

They gamble everything to try and get a decent life, riding in rickety, dangerous boats, only to get screwed over by us. It seems downright cruel! 

 80% of the world's wealth is held by 20% of the worlds population. Aussies fit into this 20% richest category. We also have an extremely low population density, so we have plenty of space. 

Its almost ironic that after we invade, nearly annihilating the original australians (on purpose!) we then have the hide to turn and say to people worse-off than ourselves 'you can't come in'. 

This whole issue makes me somewhat ashamed to be an Australian.  

I have given my opinion, and I feel have resonably justified it. I ask that you guys do the same, whatever country you are from."

Of course we were both upset, but i managed to ignore him for three months. He then told me that it was a mistake and that he still loved me etc. So, after a bit of persuasion (from him of course), we got back together again and I told him he had one more chance. However, seven months later and he cheated on me again with the same girl! That really annoyed me and i didn't listen to what he had to say and split up with him again. That happened a few months ago, but i still love him, though I can't forgive him for what he's done, espically when he has cheated on me twice. What should I do now??"

The problem is that they eat an insanely large amount of food.  I have a hard time keeping up.  There are 2 of them and they are babies.  Not every day but sometimes I give them some cooked rice or toast made from homemade bread.  I just feel like they are hungry and need something to fill them up.  I'm sure pellets contain grains and things.  They love love love eating and squeal at me every time they see me if they feel like they don't have enough food.  Their cage is okay sized, gets completely cleaned every day, but for many hours of the day they get to run around in a huge area and eat there too.

The thing is her family and my family celebrate it on the same day (Christmas Eve.. weird but it's our tradition). Anyways, my girlfriend told me that I should spend it with her family, but when I told her I couldn't because my family is spending it on Christmas Eve too, she got mad at me. She said that I have to make a sacrifice and go with her family. I told her that on Christmas day I could be with her, but she said that there's nothing special because there's nothing going on that day and I told her it is special b/c it's Christmas day & any moment should be special as long as we're together. She still said no and stayed angry that I can't go to her family's Christmas get together. I know that when it's a marriage, it's different and there are going to be sacrifices, but right now we're just boyfriend and girlfriend. It is a serious relationship, but I told her that family comes first, until we have our own family together. And she got angry when I said that too and said that she's going to spend Christmas with her family every year even when were married, and that I have to be with her. So I can't spend Christmas with my family. This really has me down, because I'm not going to be able to see her at all this Christmas, because I can't go to her family's Christmas party, and she doesn't want me to spend Christmas day with her (because there's nothing special that day...?), and afterwards she leaves for a week for Christmas eve.

I know men who live in apartments while their ex-wives in live take the majority of the MENS networth for themselves as they sit on their ***. It is nothing but a wealth transfer scam. If your married for more than 10 years, its FOR LIFE. 

Even middle-class men who make hundreds of thousands of dollars are sometimes after all the red tape is done have to live on less than 10,000 dollars. 

No man should have to take this risk just to find the love of his life. Its jumping off a burning bridge and hoping you aren't the one who she is going to destroy for greed. 

Why are men still getting married? There is no ""right woman"". These are imperfect women who are given full power and authority by YOUR OWN SIGNATURE that they have the capability to do this, should she leave or you leave.  

In rare cases women have to pay alimony if they make more money which i'm ALSO against. No one should be PAYING another ADULT if there is a break-up or split. Marriage will continue to decline as tryanny such as these continue and go unchecked. 

Women often say men fear commitment, you would too if you realize the loaded gun thats pointed at your head. 

So what is the benfiets of marriage? For women, pretty much everything. For men, absolutely nothing but slavery. Men should AVOID marriage at all costs for their own saftey. I don't want to hear the ""NAWALT"" card. Even if women aren't like that, its STILL NOT WORTH THE RISK OF DOING THIS ACT."

https://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20130520104444AAfhNoO,Should I worry about my 14 year old daughter's relationship with her boyfriend?,0," My 14 year old daughter has been in a relationship with a boy (of the same age) for six months now.  I really like the boy...seems really nice and treats my daughter well.  However, I feel like their relationship may be moving too fast.  I guess that I am trying to determine if their behavior is normal or should I be concerned?  This boy told my daughter that he loved her fairly early on in the relationship (which I figured was normal...the excitement of a new relationship).  He then began to tell her that he wanted to marry her - he tells her that he wants to have kids with her and he calls her by his last name.  He has even point blank asked her to marry him.  Again, I might just blow this off ... figure ""first love"" stuff again and hormones and that they will grow out of it.  However, I have noticed that they also share extremely personal information with each other and have discussions about subjects that seem inappropriate (ex. when she is menstruating - how many 14 year old boys really want to know about this stuff?).  My daughter has told me that they both intend to hold off on sex until they are married (which I also think is a very mature conversation for two 14 year olds), but I have caught them being a little touchy, feely.  I caught her reaching under his shirt to touch his stomach and she has admitted that he has grabbed her behind and reached under her shirt to touch her back.  I have tried to explain to my daughter that their behavior is inappropriate and that it can very easily lead to more temptation.  I am worried at this point and not sure how to deal with this.  I am afraid that if I push too hard, she will no longer confide in me and they may do something foolish.  Should I trust that this is not going to go any farther?  I am not just worried about the physical relationship, but also the emotional.  They want to spend all of their time together.  They text as soon as they wake up and continue the entire day.  They even want to facetime as they go to sleep.  They both prefer to be with each other instead of friends.  I try to remember what it was like to be young and in love, but there are alarm bells going off.  I am not sure...should I worry or not?  Am I hovering too much?  Is this normal behavior for 14 year olds?"

The oil on the dipstick is black, but seems to be of a good consistency - no gritty feel.  This is the first diesel I've owned, and am used to seeing semi-transparent oil in a petrol engine.  The sticker on the screen indicates the oil was changed maybe 6000km ago - I assume a 20000km interval for diesels?  Can you answer this one too - I usually change the oil in my cars (petrol) every 6000km,  what interval should I be using for the diesel?  By the way the van has a 274000km on the clock.  Should I use an engine flush when changing the oil?"

https://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20130405084944AAT7UwF,SHOULD I HAVE SEX AT 15!? (condoms)?,0," So my boyfriend and I have been dating for about 6 months now and we are 15. Upper classman guys at my school constantly tell us to be safe,use protection, and ask if we want any condoms. I thought this guy(good friend) was I kidding so I said yes and he gave my boyfriend three condoms the next day. My boyfriend is giving them to me to keep in my bag at school so nobody finds out. a couple of guys know that we have them and are probably going to tell everyone, but we're both Virgins. I want to have.sex with him and trust me I'm not a ****. Is it okay? The only reason I'm having second thoughts is because I don't want others finding out and pregnancy scares. What should I do, and why do guys ask us if we want condoms? They said they don't want us to have a kid.

https://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20111030152305AA0nPZy,"Should I read ""The Origin of Species"" next?",1," Hey, guys. So, I'm trying to decide whether or not I should read ""The Origin of Species"" next (I own it, by the way), because it's an old book. I've read many evolutionary biology books (I just finished ""The Selfish Gene"" today, and I've read ""The Greatest Show on Earth"", ""Your Inner Fish"", to name a few). I've been told Origin is a boring book, and because Darwin had no idea about genes, of course, it's outdated. But I also want to read the book that inspired these other books I've read. 

So, what do you think? Should I read it? Thanks!"
