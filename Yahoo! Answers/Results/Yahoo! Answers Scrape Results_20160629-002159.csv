Last night it took 4 hours to raise the temperature 10' (F) in my house -- although it was about 5' outside. 

At the boiler, both the feed pipe and the return pipe feel very hot -- I can't hold them for more than a second.  It just doesn't feel like I am getting that much heat upstairs in the actual baseboards."

But I feel like it just means that I'm not good enough sexually. Am I wrong to think this? I told him I don't want him to watch it again, but I know I can't stop him. So I'm trying to learn to deal with it. Am I overreacting by getting extremely upset over this? Our relationship is pretty good but I can't help but feel jealous. He sets his search history to private, and I bashed at him for that. Am I being obsessive or should I let him have his privacy? I hate feeling like he is thinking of a porn star while we are getting sexual. I have horrible anxiety and this is my first real relationship and I don't want to ruin it by being controlling. But does his watching porn affect our relationship or how he thinks of me sexually? Does it mean I'm not good enough? Somebody please give me an opinion.-. Thank you."

The thing is her family and my family celebrate it on the same day (Christmas Eve.. weird but it's our tradition). Anyways, my girlfriend told me that I should spend it with her family, but when I told her I couldn't because my family is spending it on Christmas Eve too, she got mad at me. She said that I have to make a sacrifice and go with her family. I told her that on Christmas day I could be with her, but she said that there's nothing special because there's nothing going on that day and I told her it is special b/c it's Christmas day & any moment should be special as long as we're together. She still said no and stayed angry that I can't go to her family's Christmas get together. I know that when it's a marriage, it's different and there are going to be sacrifices, but right now we're just boyfriend and girlfriend. It is a serious relationship, but I told her that family comes first, until we have our own family together. And she got angry when I said that too and said that she's going to spend Christmas with her family every year even when were married, and that I have to be with her. So I can't spend Christmas with my family. This really has me down, because I'm not going to be able to see her at all this Christmas, because I can't go to her family's Christmas party, and she doesn't want me to spend Christmas day with her (because there's nothing special that day...?), and afterwards she leaves for a week for Christmas eve. 

Anyways, my question(s) are: does my girlfriend have a right to be angry at me? Did I go about this wrong? What should I do to fix this? 

Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks so much & Merry Christmas :)"
https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20111202143752AA2gLuI,Do you think alimony should be abolished?,0," It is nothing but slavery to men in the highest degree which we supposably ""outlawed"".  

I know men who live in apartments while their ex-wives in live take the majority of the MENS networth for themselves as they sit on their ***. It is nothing but a wealth transfer scam. If your married for more than 10 years, its FOR LIFE. 

Even middle-class men who make hundreds of thousands of dollars are sometimes after all the red tape is done have to live on less than 10,000 dollars. 

No man should have to take this risk just to find the love of his life. Its jumping off a burning bridge and hoping you aren't the one who she is going to destroy for greed. 

Why are men still getting married? There is no ""right woman"". These are imperfect women who are given full power and authority by YOUR OWN SIGNATURE that they have the capability to do this, should she leave or you leave.  

In rare cases women have to pay alimony if they make more money which i'm ALSO against. No one should be PAYING another ADULT if there is a break-up or split. Marriage will continue to decline as tryanny such as these continue and go unchecked. 

Women often say men fear commitment, you would too if you realize the loaded gun thats pointed at your head. 

So what is the benfiets of marriage? For women, pretty much everything. For men, absolutely nothing but slavery. Men should AVOID marriage at all costs for their own saftey. I don't want to hear the ""NAWALT"" card. Even if women aren't like that, its STILL NOT WORTH THE RISK OF DOING THIS ACT."

The widths of my existing doors are 30 3/4 inches, and 30 1/2 inches. The guy at the hardware store suggested that I go with a 30 inch widths for the new doors, and now I'm having doubts.  

The space in between the frames (which I'm keeping) appears to be exactly 30 inches wide - is it necessary to have a little extra width on either side of the door, overlapping the frame?  Should I change the order to go up to the next size (32 inch width) and shave the new doors down to match the existing ones, or will I really be O.K. with the 30 inch width for the new ones?

https://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=20110216131436AAoO5q8,"Should I move to Atlanta to start a new life, how's life there?",5," I am looking for a city similar to NYC but I dont wanna move to Miami or LA 

Atlanta is the only other major one that crosses my mind but I have only been there once. My cousin lives there, I think he lives in buck head or bank head, not sure. His apartment complex is the most luxurious gated complex I have ever seen. It looked like it was built for royalty, you actually have to dial at the gate for him to open it. And the call goes straight to his cell and he can open it from there. We dont have stuff like that in NY. He only pays $900 for a 2 bedroom, thats great. I am tired of suffering in NY paying $1500 for a small sh*t hole, I need to move to the south! NYC is too overrated  

I am a Trinidadian so I wanna go to place with lots of immigrants (whether it be Russians, Indian, Jamaicans, Africans...etc), lots of restaurants (such as Spanish and Caribbean restaurant), public transport so I wont have to rely on my car, lots of jobs, night life...etc 

Is Atlanta the place for me? 

From what I heard Atlanta is on the rise ad will be the next big thing 

When I was younger no one cared about Atlanta and it was just known for hair and pimpin, but now Atlanta seems like heaven. Everyone is moving from the North to the South because they realized the North is expensive and its a sh*t hole. Everyone is come to TN, GA and TX 

Whats your take on it, and should I move here? 

I have like 5k saved up so that should get me into an apartment with a down payment. The same week I move there I will take my security Guard course (which is like 1 hr) and get the certificate, I will then apply for my Georgia guard card and work as a security guard until I settle down and find a better job. They are always on need of security guards and it looks better of you have your guard card so I think thats agood plan to keep me afloat while getting situated. APD is also hiring and I am going to go to their job fair this Saturday to put in an application there as well 

I plan on making the final move in MAY after I finish up this semester in NY, I am not sure which college I wanna transfer too but I will put college on hold until I get a steady job that can pay the rent 

What do you think about my plan? I wanna enjoy life and not have to struggle, anyone who lived in NY knows its a struggle"

https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20130424205710AAdHggN,When should I give up my virginity?,1," I'm a 20 year old woman and I have never had any experience with dating besides for a short period in high school. My mother set me up on a date with someone she know who is 22. She always does this to get be to become more social. I started texting this guy and it turned out we had a lot in common. When we went on a date together, he was such a gentlemen. He paid for everything and dealt with my awkwardness which I have a feeling he thinks is cute. By the end of the night he figured out I was a virgin by my reactions to some funny sexual jokes. I wasn't put off by them because my friends and I joke too but I still blushed. He was fine with me being inexperienced. We text constantly and they are usually flirty and get naughty. I play along with them because it's fun but I feel like the next time I see him, which is this weekend, he might want to seriously do sexual things with me. Again, me being inexperienced and awkward, I'm a little scared. It's not that I think my virginity is something special, I just don't feel comfortable about myself. I am always told I have a nice body and I love it. It's just that I'm going to be exposed to someone else who I have only known for a month. I'm not even sure if we are in a relationship or just dating. I do believe that I can do some things and if it goes too far I'll tell him to slack off but is it too soon to be doing any of this with him? 

Truth be told this guy is on my mind almost all the time. My friends noticed a change in me saying I'm more lively and talkative. I never get noticed by guys but this one seems genuinely interested in me and I really like him. I'm just afraid that I'm letting things move too fast.

I know I want to do one of those three jobs because I am very interested in health care, the human body, and helping others. I am a very compassionate person and many people have told me this. I love helping people who are in a weak and vulnerable state. I helped care for my grandma everyday when she was dying ( basically doing the duties of a cna). I found it to be very fulfilling to alleviate her pain. I do not want to be a nurse, however, because I want to do something more in depth, like diagnostic stuff. I think it would be the best thing in the world to save someone's life. I am concerned about trying to become a doctor because of how difficult it is to get into med school and also the difficulty of med school itself. That's why I was considering physician assistant; and also because I heard they do less paper work and don't have to deal with lawsuits. I am considering physical therapist because quite a few people have told me I should become a physical therapist ( including a physical therapist) and because they spend so much time with patients and I would be able to express my compassion. I also am an avid runner and have dealt with a lot of running injuries so that has given me some experience with pt. What should I do?"
https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100810130626AACo6ql,Should men pay for everything?,3," True Story....I was dating this girl for quite some time and found myself paying for everything 95% of the time.  I didn't have a problem paying cuz it sort of made me feel good and never really thought twice about it.  However, when things started to get serious she brought up the topic of ""money"".  She believes that the man should pay all the time.  Infact, she EXPECTS it.  Here's the funny thing.  We both make the same amount of money.  We both have the same amount of debt to pay off (which is hardly any).   Her explanation was that she likes to feel taken care of.  I know this is a very ""old fashioned"" way of thinking and I'm actually very much for it, however this rule only applies to women who don't have jobs and choose to stay home in order to cook, clean, and take care of the family. This girl does not know how to do any of these things.  Why is it that most women who demand independence don't really know the true meaning of it?  If you want the man to pay for everything, then shouldn't the woman put into the relationship (like cook, clean, drive, other house duties, etc)?  No. Sex is not payment.  That's equivalent to being a prostitute.  You're thoughts on this subject?"

https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20160628202442AAtU3UU,Should I tell an adult about my friend s self harm problem?,0," My friend came to my cabin recently, and my parents were forewarned that she would try and avoid eating. She has anorexia, you see. She is also very depressed. I knew about her eating disorder long before she told me, because she would call herself fat, avoid coming over for tea when there was food involved, and hide in her room or the restroom after big meals. But at the cabin, she told me about her self harm problem. Well, actually, I asked her how she got some strangely consistent cuts on her calf and wrist. I knew what was coming, and she admitted to have engaged in self harm. She says her mom stole her pocket knife after she lied and said that she was doing it with that, but she confided in me that she has been using a razor blade. If I tell my parents to tell her parents, I would ask them to make sure she doesn t know it was me. But still, it s betrayal of her secret. I just really want my friend to feel better. Should I tell her mom that it was really a razor blade, or would that be an act of cruel unfriendliness? Also, (I know this is a long question but it s really important) do you think she is still cutting her, and how should I find out whether or not it s still an issue, when she almost always covers it up?"

We moved in Christmas week. For a while I have been hearing noises in my room. I saw something, human-like, climbing up my wall. Another time, I was at my grandma's house and i saw a figure of a girl next to me in the mirror. What ever it is, knows my name and calls to me sometimes. My friend also has a similar problem, so we used a ouija board I found at my old house. That night i heard an old man and woman talking in my room. It was a different language, but I knew they were having a conversation. I woke up and said shhh and they stopped, then they started to talk again. They were like chanting or something. Then earlier this morning, I heard something moving things and opening and closing the drawers. Then it said my name. I said, mom i know that's you but she wasnt upstairs, she was in the cellar, and everyone else was downstairs. I could feel it watching me. Sometimes my mom makes fun of me for saying that there is a ghost in my house, and I told her to stop. I'm getting kinda scared now, and don't know what to do. Is it a ghost or a demon? Please help. I'm getting my house blessed sometime and I am just really freaked out. It's like just with me, nobody else will believe me, except 2 of my friends and my cousin. What do I do?"

Not every day but sometimes I give them some cooked rice or toast made from homemade bread.  I just feel like they are hungry and need something to fill them up.  I'm sure pellets contain grains and things.  They love love love eating and squeal at me every time they see me if they feel like they don't have enough food.  Their cage is okay sized, gets completely cleaned every day, but for many hours of the day they get to run around in a huge area and eat there too.

The thing is her family and my family celebrate it on the same day (Christmas Eve.. weird but it's our tradition). Anyways, my girlfriend told me that I should spend it with her family, but when I told her I couldn't because my family is spending it on Christmas Eve too, she got mad at me. She said that I have to make a sacrifice and go with her family. I told her that on Christmas day I could be with her, but she said that there's nothing special because there's nothing going on that day and I told her it is special b/c it's Christmas day & any moment should be special as long as we're together. She still said no and stayed angry that I can't go to her family's Christmas get together. I know that when it's a marriage, it's different and there are going to be sacrifices, but right now we're just boyfriend and girlfriend. It is a serious relationship, but I told her that family comes first, until we have our own family together. And she got angry when I said that too and said that she's going to spend Christmas with her family every year even when were married, and that I have to be with her. So I can't spend Christmas with my family. This really has me down, because I'm not going to be able to see her at all this Christmas, because I can't go to her family's Christmas party, and she doesn't want me to spend Christmas day with her (because there's nothing special that day...?), and afterwards she leaves for a week for Christmas eve. 

Anyways, my question(s) are: does my girlfriend have a right to be angry at me? Did I go about this wrong? What should I do to fix this? 

Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks so much & Merry Christmas :)"

https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20111202143752AA2gLuI,Do you think alimony should be abolished?,0," It is nothing but slavery to men in the highest degree which we supposably ""outlawed"".  

I know men who live in apartments while their ex-wives in live take the majority of the MENS networth for themselves as they sit on their ***. It is nothing but a wealth transfer scam. If your married for more than 10 years, its FOR LIFE. 

Even middle-class men who make hundreds of thousands of dollars are sometimes after all the red tape is done have to live on less than 10,000 dollars. 

No man should have to take this risk just to find the love of his life. Its jumping off a burning bridge and hoping you aren't the one who she is going to destroy for greed. 

Why are men still getting married? There is no ""right woman"". These are imperfect women who are given full power and authority by YOUR OWN SIGNATURE that they have the capability to do this, should she leave or you leave.  

In rare cases women have to pay alimony if they make more money which i'm ALSO against. No one should be PAYING another ADULT if there is a break-up or split. Marriage will continue to decline as tryanny such as these continue and go unchecked. 

Women often say men fear commitment, you would too if you realize the loaded gun thats pointed at your head. 

So what is the benfiets of marriage? For women, pretty much everything. For men, absolutely nothing but slavery. Men should AVOID marriage at all costs for their own saftey. I don't want to hear the ""NAWALT"" card. Even if women aren't like that, its STILL NOT WORTH THE RISK OF DOING THIS ACT."

We both have the same amount of debt to pay off (which is hardly any).   Her explanation was that she likes to feel taken care of.  I know this is a very ""old fashioned"" way of thinking and I'm actually very much for it, however this rule only applies to women who don't have jobs and choose to stay home in order to cook, clean, and take care of the family. This girl does not know how to do any of these things.  Why is it that most women who demand independence don't really know the true meaning of it?

Everything I could ever ask her except for in the bedroom. I am very sexually frustrated. He doesn t start anything, he refuses to touch my VAG and over all leaves me unsatisfied. I have told him a million times and he just doesn t care. I literally stop in the middle of the little interocurse I seduce him into to ask him if he is asleep. He lays back with his eyes closed like if he s bored or something. He finds my wetness ""nasty"" and oral is obviously never an option. I find myself thinking about literally any other man and I feel like this is affecting my integrity and love for him. I choose to be with him because I don t want to loose an amazing person over sex yet I can t help but feel unhappy. What do I do??? Do I talk to him...even more or should I call the quits? I know I can t marry and live like this but I know I would be loosing an amazing husband and father to my future children. Is sex worth it ? Can I live without it?"

Its not that he wants to replace them; he wants to pry all of the baseboards to paint them & the walls and then put the old repainted baseboards back up.  This sounds like an unnecessary step to me because we run the risk of breaking them, or forgetting where each piece goes, and well still have to fill the nail holes and paint over those once we reinstall the boards.

https://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=20090908220555AAdIOlC,How tight should the tank be attached to the toilet?,2," I recently replaced an old leaky toilet with an American Standard Champion 4 model.  I'm a pretty competent DIY'er but am a bit concerned about how tightly to run down the through bolts that attach the tank to the toilet bowl. 

The instructions say, and I quote:  ""With the tank parallel to wall, alternately tighten hex nuts until tank is snugged down evenly against bowl surface."" 

OK, here's my concern.  If it's overtightened you risk breaking a new $300 toilet.  But the rubber gasket is fairly tightly compressed and the tank is not yet touching the lands on the back of the toilet bowl.  It's tilted slightly forward (about 1/8"" inch space between the rear lands than the front one where the tank is touching the bowl) but does not wiggle with moderate pressure.  Everything works fine, no leaks, etc.  But it just looks like it's not tightened down enough. 

Do I risk breaking the new toilet by carefully running the nuts even tighter until the rear of the tank rests on the lands on the back of the bowl?  (A test fit without the gasket had the tank squarely on the toilet bowl.)  Or should I leave it as is since everything works properly even though the tank IS still tilted slightly forward? 

Any guidance from experienced plumbers is greatly appreciated."

Atlanta is the only other major one that crosses my mind but I have only been there once. My cousin lives there, I think he lives in buck head or bank head, not sure. His apartment complex is the most luxurious gated complex I have ever seen. It looked like it was built for royalty, you actually have to dial at the gate for him to open it. And the call goes straight to his cell and he can open it from there. We dont have stuff like that in NY. He only pays $900 for a 2 bedroom, thats great. I am tired of suffering in NY paying $1500 for a small sh*t hole, I need to move to the south! NYC is too overrated  

I am a Trinidadian so I wanna go to place with lots of immigrants (whether it be Russians, Indian, Jamaicans, Africans...etc), lots of restaurants (such as Spanish and Caribbean restaurant), public transport so I wont have to rely on my car, lots of jobs, night life...etc 

Is Atlanta the place for me? 

From what I heard Atlanta is on the rise ad will be the next big thing 

When I was younger no one cared about Atlanta and it was just known for hair and pimpin, but now Atlanta seems like heaven. Everyone is moving from the North to the South because they realized the North is expensive and its a sh*t hole. Everyone is come to TN, GA and TX 

Whats your take on it, and should I move here? 

I have like 5k saved up so that should get me into an apartment with a down payment. The same week I move there I will take my security Guard course (which is like 1 hr) and get the certificate, I will then apply for my Georgia guard card and work as a security guard until I settle down and find a better job. They are always on need of security guards and it looks better of you have your guard card so I think thats agood plan to keep me afloat while getting situated. APD is also hiring and I am going to go to their job fair this Saturday to put in an application there as well

Its not that he wants to replace them; he wants to pry all of the baseboards to paint them & the walls and then put the old repainted baseboards back up.  This sounds like an unnecessary step to me because we run the risk of breaking them, or forgetting where each piece goes, and well still have to fill the nail holes and paint over those once we reinstall the boards.    

After running through a list of people I know who have painted their homes in recent memory and finding no one who has engaged in this practice, I asked, Who do you know that has actually done this?  His response: Lots of people.  (In his language, this translates to No one I know has actually done this, but I refuse to admit that.)

I'm going to try and keep this as short and thorough as I can. 
I had my head banged against a brick wall 9 days ago. It's a long story, but I went to the hospital a few hours later for a severe headache. I got a cat scan and the doctors said they believe I'm fine. The scan was normal and I passed all my reflex tests and d (I took a Tylenol). 
Keep in mind it's 9 days later, there was never any bleeding or vomiting, and I have drank alcohol and gotten drunk (I'm 21 years old lol)  since then and am totally fine. 
But I have hypochondria and I'm wondering if I should be concerned about this headache? Should I go to the ER? 
It'd really be a waste of over 12 hours (suuuuch a long wait at my local hospital) just for a headache. 
So I guess my real question is, is it likely that I have internal bleeding or something that showed up after the first cat scan and surpassed and survived all the alcohol and heavy lifting I've been doing this week? Or is it just a headache because I have a stressful job that's really hot and migraines happen?

The back of my neck also became swollen. Yesterday it was hurting and my right arm and should had pain in it and pain started to go to my collarbone too. I also took 600 mg of ibuprofen yesterday and later in the night took 800 mg and the ibprofen has not been helping. Hot baths and showers and the heating pad are not helping. I have been icing it as well and it isn't helping. Today both of arms and shoulder hurt as well as both sides and the back of my neck. The swelling is in the middle of my neck right over my spinal cord in the back of my neck and hurts when I touch it and causes a headache. I also have been really tired when waking up and feel like I have not slept. It hurts to do my makeup, hair, lift things up, move my neck, etc. I feel pain and stiffness all over my neck and shoulders. Today though my arms and shoulders are not hurting, but the middle of my neck and some of my back hurt. The stiff feeling is going away and does not hurt much when I turn my head to the side. I do get headaches if I touch the area that is hurt. Should I go to the doctors in the next few days or keep icing it, putting heat on it, and taking 800 mg ibuprofen?"

They are usually a few years above me and i am scared when they are outside. Sometimes they knock on the door as a joke but it makes me feel so embarrassed. 

So what i do it put 2 pads on in the day and then at lunch time (4 hours) i rip it off quickly pop it in the bin and have a fresh new one, i squirt some perfume on my crotch area (with my trousers on) when am finished. 

I'm not sure if this will get rid of the scent or not?

Anyway, i don't want her to know if that's what your thinking:)

https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20130312114142AAHOXPw,I am a gay Muslim. I feel sick!! What should I do?,1," I am an 18 years old guy. When I was younger I had always thought that I was weird somehow. Im Muslim, and I come from a really strict family. My country doesnt speak about homosexuality at all. Actually, if you are caught in action with another man, youre going to be put to death. I was born gay, and I have never had deep nor sexual feelings for a female. That is why I get really mad when people say communicate with God and he will heal you and make you straight. Well, he didnt. I respect all religions, and I do believe in God. Thats why when I was younger I tried to pray and ask God to release me from this curse Im in. Nobody knows that I am gay. Its not an easy subject to discuss in my country because most of the people are extremists and strict Muslims. When I was living back home I had always thought that its a passing thing and I will be straight when I grow up and marry a woman and have kids. But, I moved to the United States for a couple of years to study. I actually just got to the United States. So, I will have 3 more years here.  Before I moved here I would consider myself religious and thats why I couldnt believe that God made me this way. But, when I moved here everything about me has changed, I literally started to see the World from a different angle. I started accepting myself, but Im really devastated and depressed. Suicide is one of the biggest sins that you could ever commit as a person in Islam and actually that is the only reason that is keeping me going. I have always had suicidal thoughts but I never acted on them. Still, I am always depressed to the part where I stop eating for days, and its not because Im trying to kill myself, but whenever I eat I throw up. Knowing for a fact that eventually I will not have someone to love or kids really devastates me. And this continuous fear that if someone figures out who I really am, I will be killed really terrifies me. Also, if I do tell my parents that I am gay there is a high chance that they would disown me. I got to this point where I dont care about my life, I just need someone to love or talk to. Its true what they say Life is Mystery. I have no idea where life is taking me. I am on a vacation now, and all I did was pretend that I am sick so I dont go outside and see people because all I see are families with kids. And this makes me even sicker. The issue is that my scholarship pays my tuition, but I MUST work for them for five years (in my country). I think I need to either sacrifice my family to find someone who loves me and move away with him (this will also kill me because during this period in the US I get homesick sometimes). So, I cant see myself ditching my family forever. Why is God torturing me? He made me gay and made me SO emotionally needy and then he says its forbidden to love someone from your same gender. I feel sick. Any suggestions what can I do with my life?"

https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20130312114142AAHOXPw,I am a gay Muslim. I feel sick!! What should I do?,1," I am an 18 years old guy. When I was younger I had always thought that I was weird somehow. Im Muslim, and I come from a really strict family. My country doesnt speak about homosexuality at all. Actually, if you are caught in action with another man, youre going to be put to death. I was born gay, and I have never had deep nor sexual feelings for a female. That is why I get really mad when people say communicate with God and he will heal you and make you straight. Well, he didnt. I respect all religions, and I do believe in God. Thats why when I was younger I tried to pray and ask God to release me from this curse Im in. Nobody knows that I am gay. Its not an easy subject to discuss in my country because most of the people are extremists and strict Muslims. When I was living back home I had always thought that its a passing thing and I will be straight when I grow up and marry a woman and have kids. But, I moved to the United States for a couple of years to study. I actually just got to the United States. So, I will have 3 more years here.  Before I moved here I would consider myself religious and thats why I couldnt believe that God made me this way. But, when I moved here everything about me has changed, I literally started to see the World from a different angle. I started accepting myself, but Im really devastated and depressed. Suicide is one of the biggest sins that you could ever commit as a person in Islam and actually that is the only reason that is keeping me going. I have always had suicidal thoughts but I never acted on them. Still, I am always depressed to the part where I stop eating for days, and its not because Im trying to kill myself, but whenever I eat I throw up. Knowing for a fact that eventually I will not have someone to love or kids really devastates me. And this continuous fear that if someone figures out who I really am, I will be killed really terrifies me. Also, if I do tell my parents that I am gay there is a high chance that they would disown me. I got to this point where I dont care about my life, I just need someone to love or talk to. Its true what they say Life is Mystery. I have no idea where life is taking me. I am on a vacation now, and all I did was pretend that I am sick so I dont go outside and see people because all I see are families with kids. And this makes me even sicker. The issue is that my scholarship pays my tuition, but I MUST work for them for five years (in my country). I think I need to either sacrifice my family to find someone who loves me and move away with him (this will also kill me because during this period in the US I get homesick sometimes). So, I cant see myself ditching my family forever. Why is God torturing me? He made me gay and made me SO emotionally needy and then he says its forbidden to love someone from your same gender. I feel sick. Any suggestions what can I do with my life?"

We get 20 channels and half of them are in Spanish and most of the other ones are the same thing on 2 or 3 channels. The only channels we get are several news channels, pbs, and that's pretty much it. I want to buy a Roku or something like that. We have WiFi. I was thinking of buying a Roku, either Hulu Plus or Netflix, and then MLB.tv. In the end, would that be cheaper than what we're paying now or a little more a month but worth it because of the more channels?  

Roku: $49.99-$99.99, depending on the model 
Netflix: $7.99/month 
Hulu Plus: $7.99/month 
MLB.tv: $124.99/year, = about $15/month for the months we would have it, but we would have to pay the full amount up front, not monthly. 
I think the monthly subscription fees would equal out to about the same, would it be worth it? And then there's the harder question: Netflix or Hulu Plus? I've heard Netflix is better for watching movies and Hulu Plus is better for watching TV shows because there's more of a selection, but when I searched their selections, Netflix had more of the TV shows we would potentially be watching. If we get a Roku, I would do the free trial of each before deciding. What do you think I should do? Thanks!"

https://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=20100826024255AAH7Leh,Should women be allowed to go topless in public...or not?,3," Hi folks. 

When viewing an enlightening article on CNN this morning, I was moved to consider the question of whether women should or should not be allowed to be topless in public. 

After some thought on the subject, here is what I found to be the primary motivators on both sides of the issue, namely... 

THE ""PROS"": 

1. Freedom. 

There is much to be applauded about living in a free society without any question whatsoever...but how far should freedom be allowed to go without society being degraded? 

2. Equality. 

The women who insist that they should have the same rights as men are quite vehement about their cause, and from my viewpoint this is quite understandable...but are these women 100% certain of their real true motivations behind the claim of ""Equality"", or is it simply veiled jealousy of men's ability to be seen in a non-sexual light when their shirts are off, or if that is not exactly correct, at least far less sexually provocative as women are with their breasts fully exposed? 

And also, are these women who are firm supporters (no bra puns intended ladies) in actuality simply trying to gain even more attention than they already get for themselves everyday, while hiding under the auspices of ""Freedom"" and ""Equality""? 

There is another side to this issue, but I think it belongs in the following catagory. 

THE ""CONS"": 

1. The Morality Issue. 

With the knowledege that there are most certainly tribal societies that have existed for countless centuries that allow women to bare their breasts publicly, still, our modern ""Civilized"" society is factually not ready for such things, and perhaps there may be good reasons...but from my viewpoint not necessarily for the reasons forwarded by the followers of most established religions. 

In other words, what I mean is that factually speaking, modern heterosexual men are highly attracted to women's breasts to the point of intense feverishness, and women know this by the way - which shows a clear reason why many women might wish to have the attention poured upon them in such a way, but there are factually men who cannot control themselves when they are confronted by such an obvious and open display of female sexuality, from which breasts cannot easily or simply be removed...true or not true? 

For this reason, perhaps the laws are in place not to ""resrict"" women from their inherent freedoms, but rather to PROTECT THEM from men or persons that may simply not be able to control themselves, especially when drunk or on drugs, etc.. 

If this is the case, which I think it very likely is, then that would mean that by removing the laws, women in favor of this would then be literally removing a potentially vital layer of protection which keeps them safe to walk the streets at any time of the day or night. 

2. And lastly, there is the issue of common decency. 

Look, although we might be intelligent beings and have the sovereign right to all good freedoms in general, not all women happen to look like Claudia Schiffer, Gisele Bundchen or Naomi Cambell. 

In fact, let's face it...most women do not do not look like these incredible, super-bodied, gorgeous icon-like women, and they simply never will. 

(Sorry ladies, but this is a fact)! 

Therefore, is it not also the sovereign right of all those (the masses including small children) who would then become forced onlookers of the bare breasted women in question to have their rights upheld and not be forced to have to view legions of boob-airing women exercising their right to expose their not-necessarily-so-beautiful-looking mammaries in public? 

And what about the women themselves? 

Even if their breasts are possibly somehow even better looking than a supermodel's, what about their own sense of decency and the other issue of feeling good about being protected from those unwanted persons who would not be able to control their actions by seeing them in such a state of un-dress? 

The true end point of this seems to revolve more around the concept of the interaction between freedom of exposure versus freedom from being sexually provoked on the other side of the issue, and the potentially devastating consequences that could arise from this freedom being violated - such as rape and/or sexually aggravated assault or even worse. 

Women who wish to bare their breasts publicly should perhaps theoretically have the right to do so, but conversely, the innocent masses who wish to retain the freedom to be free of being forced to deal with viewing hordes of topless women parade around in public also have rights...yea, or nay?

Anyways, do you think I have a chance of becoming a kpop idol? PLEASE BE HONEST I INSIST. 
If you think so, what companies do you think I should audition for that are the most accepting of foreigners? 

Thanks in advance =-)"

If it would be easier to get a job with part-time hours, I could just get a second part-time job to compliment the other. However, either way, I need 30 - 40 hours of work.

I would NEVER do anything to hurt him, ever. But my friend thinks I should let him know about it. She says it's better to tell him than to find out  from other people. I feel that you shouldn't judge anyone on past events, because everyone has to learn and change and grow. What do you think? Should I tell him or just live happily in the present?"

https://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=20100826024255AAH7Leh,Should women be allowed to go topless in public...or not?,3," Hi folks. 

When viewing an enlightening article on CNN this morning, I was moved to consider the question of whether women should or should not be allowed to be topless in public. 

After some thought on the subject, here is what I found to be the primary motivators on both sides of the issue, namely... 

THE ""PROS"": 

1. Freedom. 

There is much to be applauded about living in a free society without any question whatsoever...but how far should freedom be allowed to go without society being degraded? 

2. Equality. 

The women who insist that they should have the same rights as men are quite vehement about their cause, and from my viewpoint this is quite understandable...but are these women 100% certain of their real true motivations behind the claim of ""Equality"", or is it simply veiled jealousy of men's ability to be seen in a non-sexual light when their shirts are off, or if that is not exactly correct, at least far less sexually provocative as women are with their breasts fully exposed? 

And also, are these women who are firm supporters (no bra puns intended ladies) in actuality simply trying to gain even more attention than they already get for themselves everyday, while hiding under the auspices of ""Freedom"" and ""Equality""? 

There is another side to this issue, but I think it belongs in the following catagory. 

THE ""CONS"": 

1. The Morality Issue. 

With the knowledege that there are most certainly tribal societies that have existed for countless centuries that allow women to bare their breasts publicly, still, our modern ""Civilized"" society is factually not ready for such things, and perhaps there may be good reasons...but from my viewpoint not necessarily for the reasons forwarded by the followers of most established religions. 

In other words, what I mean is that factually speaking, modern heterosexual men are highly attracted to women's breasts to the point of intense feverishness, and women know this by the way - which shows a clear reason why many women might wish to have the attention poured upon them in such a way, but there are factually men who cannot control themselves when they are confronted by such an obvious and open display of female sexuality, from which breasts cannot easily or simply be removed...true or not true? 

For this reason, perhaps the laws are in place not to ""resrict"" women from their inherent freedoms, but rather to PROTECT THEM from men or persons that may simply not be able to control themselves, especially when drunk or on drugs, etc.. 

If this is the case, which I think it very likely is, then that would mean that by removing the laws, women in favor of this would then be literally removing a potentially vital layer of protection which keeps them safe to walk the streets at any time of the day or night. 

2. And lastly, there is the issue of common decency. 

Look, although we might be intelligent beings and have the sovereign right to all good freedoms in general, not all women happen to look like Claudia Schiffer, Gisele Bundchen or Naomi Cambell. 

In fact, let's face it...most women do not do not look like these incredible, super-bodied, gorgeous icon-like women, and they simply never will. 

(Sorry ladies, but this is a fact)! 

Therefore, is it not also the sovereign right of all those (the masses including small children) who would then become forced onlookers of the bare breasted women in question to have their rights upheld and not be forced to have to view legions of boob-airing women exercising their right to expose their not-necessarily-so-beautiful-looking mammaries in public? 

And what about the women themselves? 

Even if their breasts are possibly somehow even better looking than a supermodel's, what about their own sense of decency and the other issue of feeling good about being protected from those unwanted persons who would not be able to control their actions by seeing them in such a state of un-dress? 

The true end point of this seems to revolve more around the concept of the interaction between freedom of exposure versus freedom from being sexually provoked on the other side of the issue, and the potentially devastating consequences that could arise from this freedom being violated - such as rape and/or sexually aggravated assault or even worse. 

Women who wish to bare their breasts publicly should perhaps theoretically have the right to do so, but conversely, the innocent masses who wish to retain the freedom to be free of being forced to deal with viewing hordes of topless women parade around in public also have rights...yea, or nay?

I asked her why and she said it was  because her bedroom is filthy.There is dust on the furniture and clothes and toys on her bedroom floor.

The space in between the frames (which I'm keeping) appears to be exactly 30 inches wide - is it necessary to have a little extra width on either side of the door, overlapping the frame?  Should I change the order to go up to the next size (32 inch width) and shave the new doors down to match the existing ones, or will I really be O.K. with the 30 inch width for the new ones?

https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20120101030502AAQD2Hj,Should I have sex before marriage?,0," I'm a guy, I'm a freshman in college, and I'm a virgin. I'm not in a relationship, but my younger brother has recently become involved with a girl and has discussed the possibility of having sex with her. He used to be pretty strong on abstinence and ""waiting on the perfect girl"", so when he told me that he planned on having sex with her, it surprised me. Now, I'm left to wonder if being a virgin is really worth it at all. 

I've heard the generic answers. I know about pregnancy risks and STDs and all the technical stuff. That's not what I'm looking for. 

What I want to know is the personal stuff. Things that make or break a relationship, and how sex fits into making a long-term relationship work. I want your opinion. 

How do you feel about sex before marriage? Would you want to wait until marriage or do you feel like having sex before tying the knot is a must? What do you think about dating someone and figuring out he or she is a virgin? Opinions from both virgins and non-virgins are welcomed. 

There really is no right answer here, but I will pick the best answer based on who helps me out the most. Tell me what you think."
